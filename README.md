# gregors-fotogalerie - gregor's picture gallery

 This is my capstone project in my continuing education with neue fische, Hamburg.
 I'm working here with my own photos, taken seemingly alongside my walks through nature (both are my hobbies).
 And, of course, not even one line of code is written by ChatGPT, but all by myself. 

 The crud functionality I finished within 5,5 days, including all tests with maven CI and SonarQube.
 Security and login with GitHub are finished. The user handling is finished. A not logged-in user can see all pictures and each picture with it's detailed information. A logged-in user additioanly can set/unset and see their favorites. A logged-in admin additionally can post, update and delete pictures.
My gallery is online! https://gregors-picturegallery.onrender.com/ The current weather, which I fetch from the open-meteo api and cahce it, is displayed with the picture details.
 More will follow. Stay tuned!

 Feel free to look into my code and contact me.
 Best regards, Gregor
