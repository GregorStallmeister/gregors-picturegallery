# gregors-fotogalerie - gregor's picture gallery

 This is my capstone project in my continuing education with neue fische, Hamburg.
 I'm working here with my own photos, taken seemingly alongside my walks through nature (both are my hobbies).

 The crud functionality I finished within 5,5 days, including all tests with maven CI and SonarQube.
 As next steps I 'm working on security, login and docker deployment.
 More will follow. Stay tuned!

 Feel free to look into my code and contact me.
