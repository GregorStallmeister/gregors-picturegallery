# gregors-fotogalerie - gregor's picture gallery

 This is my capstone project in my continuing education with neue fische, Hamburg.
 I'm working here with my own photos, taken seemingly alongside my walks through nature (both are my hobbies).

 The crud functionality I finished within 5,5 days, including all tests with maven CI and SonarQube.
 Security and login with GitHub are finished. The user handling is finished. Currently I'm working on functionalities to set/unset and see favorites.
 As next step docker deployment to render will follow, so that you can use my app...
 More will follow. Stay tuned!

 Feel free to look into my code and contact me.
